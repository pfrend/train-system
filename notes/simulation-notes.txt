SIMULATION

simulate 4 hours, between 12 and 4. (start with just 50 minutes)

240 minutes

startTime = 0

read in leaveEvents at various times.
LeaveEvent(trainController, sim, time, trainNumber)

then ask user to advance time
sim->advanceTime(INCREMENT), this increases current time

sim should then run all events with a time smaller than currentTime



buildEvent
readyEvent
leaveEvent
arriveEvent
finishedEvent


read in trains and their departure times.
for each train, schedule a buildEvent 30 minutes before its dep time.

buildEvent calls trainController->buildTrain. if train builds, sets state to not ready and prints this out, otherwise returns false and prints out "couldn't build"

if returns true, schedule readyEvent 20 minutes in future
if false schedule buildEvent 10 minutes in future and call trainController->delayTrain(). delay train changes depTime and arrTime

readyEvent:
call trainController-readyTrain(id), this sets train state to ready and prints this out.
Schedules leave event 10 minutes in future.

leaveEvent:
calls trainController->dispatchTrain(id). Sets train state to running and prints this out.
Schedules ArriveEvent based on a trains arrTime - depTime 

ArriveEvent:
calls trainController->receiveTrain(id). Sets train state to arrived and prints this out. prints train x arrived at x at time x, x minutes late.
Schedules finishedEvent 30 minutes in future.
add to tripsOnTime if not late, otherwise add to tripsDelayed and totalMinutesDelayed (schedArrTime - arrTime). 

FinishedEvent:
Calls trainController->dismantleTrain(id). Sets train state to FINISHED. Moves all pointers for vehicles from train to station pool. prints 'train x finished, and left x vehicles at station x'.

run sim until time x, where no more trains are allowed to leave.




INFO AT ANY TIME:
get station info: number of trains, number of vehicles in pool
get train info: vehicle info, schedule info, all info


Other details:
Stations get initialized with null trains.

train shouldn't have pointer to station. it should just store the station id.
that way when adding vehicles from station, the controller can ask for the trains
vehicle list, loop through it and do what the train is currently doing.
